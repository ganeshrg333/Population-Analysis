# Population-Analysis-using-Excel
This is my personal project. This project is all about to analyze the population of the city. In this project I used Excel to analyze the Population of the city. In this project I analyze some important data like number of men vs number of women in the city, their average age, average income, their professions, average price of their cars, Number of persons with debts higher than certain amount, etc. this type of study is done in this project. As we know excel is also a part of Data Science. So, to improve my Data Science skills and to gain some knowledge; I decided to do this project.
